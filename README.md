This is a web application called " projectideas " where user can register,login, logout, create, read, update and delete his/her personalized project ideas to keep track of the project abstracts. This project is an effort from me to learn and understand Node.js, mongodb, express, bootstrap functionalities as part of Grand challenges of computing course at villanova university. I am making efforts to deploy the project on to heroku cloud server. I followed brad travesy's courses on youtube, udemy and reffered the documentations of corresponding libraries to develop the application.
