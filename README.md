“Project Ideas” is an application to jot down project ideas for a user. User can create a personalized profile of their own, write their project ideas, read their Project ideas, delete their project ideas and update their Project ideas.  This project is an effort from me to learn and understand Node.js, mongodb, express, bootstrap functionalities as part of Grand challenges of computing course at villanova university.
